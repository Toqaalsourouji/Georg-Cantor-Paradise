## Abstract

The paper explores Georg Cantor's life, his contributions to mathematics, and his most significant achievements, including Cantor's theorem and the development of set theory.

## Cantor's Life

A detailed account of Cantor's life, from his early education and influences to his groundbreaking work in mathematics. It includes his early work, education, and the challenges he faced from peers and his personal life.

## Cantor's Theorem

An in-depth explanation of Cantor's Theorem, which states that for any set, the set of all its subsets (the power set) has a strictly greater cardinality than the set itself.

## Set Theory

The document explains the fundamentals of set theory, Cantor's contributions to its development, and the significance of his work in the broader context of mathematics.

## The Continuum Hypothesis

Discussion on Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis, which postulates that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers.

## Mental Health

A look at the struggles Cantor faced with his mental health, particularly the impact of the academic opposition to his theories.

## Final Years

The concluding section covers the later years of Cantor's life, his ongoing struggles, and his enduring legacy in mathematics.

## Bibliography

The document cites various sources, including works by JÃ¸rgen Veisdal, Joe Roussos, and Richard Hammack.
